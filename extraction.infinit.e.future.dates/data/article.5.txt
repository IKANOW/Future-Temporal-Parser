Facebook might acquire 15 small companies in 2011, using the same type of strategy employed in eight buys this year.

The strategy: find niche technologies that improve or expand upon an existing Facebook feature, acquire the engineers and score their intellectual capital. That’s how the company picked up Drop.io October, plus FriendFeed and Hot Potato in August.
Some of the buys, like Zenbe, have actually been partial acquisitions that leave an even smaller company behind, yet available for future business partnerships with Facebook.
Word of the 2011 shopping plans came up during a presentation by Michael Brown, corporate development manager of Facebook at a seminar last week, according to Thomson Reuters.
Facebook can certainly afford to shop twice as much next year as 2010, based on trends in cashflow and equity. The company has a $59.4 billion valuation and a share price of $25 in private transactions. Plus, revenues may come in at $2 billion this year, more than twice the amount of 2009.
As long as the company remains privately held, no one can know for sure whether Facebook uses cash or stock to pay for acquisitions, but we suspect that more of the latter for 2011 shopping.
Which companies do you think Facebook might want to acquire next year, and how much of a shopping budget would that represent?
